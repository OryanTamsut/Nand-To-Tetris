# Project 6: The Assembler

(Was taken from: https://www.nand2tetris.org/project06)
## Background
Low-level machine programs are rarely written by humans. Typically, they are generated by compilers. \
Yet humans can inspect the translated code and learn important lessons about how to write their high-level programs better, \
in a way that avoids low-level pitfalls and exploits the underlying hardware better.\
One of the key players in this translation process is the assembler -- a program designed to translate code written in a symbolic \
machine language into code written in binary machine language.

## Objective
Write an Assembler program that translates programs written in the symbolic Hack assembly language into binary code \
that can execute on the Hack hardware platform built in the previous projects.

## how to use?
Run with: java HackAssembler Xxx.asm
This command should create a new Xxx.hack file that can be executed as-is on the Hack computer.
